    "The naive, brute force way to solve this problem is to generate each possible subsequence, testing each one for monotonicity, and keeping track of the longest one. That would be prohibitively expensive: generating each subsequence already takes $O(2^N)$ time!\n",

Then we'll try to feed some part of our input array back to it and try to extend the result. Our base cases are: an empty list (where we return 0) and an array with one element (where we return 1).\n",
