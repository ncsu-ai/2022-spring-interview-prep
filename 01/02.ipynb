    "The naive solution here would be to try every single path from every vertex, count up each path's value and keep track of the maximum value we've seen. To do this, we can use depth-first search (DFS) to try every path as well as return `None` if we come across a cycle. The [Counter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) module in Python is quite handy in this case:"
