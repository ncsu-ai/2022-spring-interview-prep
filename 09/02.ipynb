    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can approach this problem is by using [rejection sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling). First, we generate a (uniformly) random integer between `0` and `n-1` (inclusive). Then, we check whether the random integer is found within the list `lst`. If it is found, then repeat the process. If it is not found, then return that number. To make sure we can check for the presence of a number in `O(1)` time, we can put all integers in `lst` in a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this solution involves repeatedly generating a new random number, its worst-case runtime is unbounded (i.e., it could theoretically never finish execution, however that outcome is incredibly unlikely). The initial call also incurs $O(N)$ to convert the input list into a set. The probability of selecting a random number depends on the the ratio of numbers in `lst` that are within the bounds `0` to `n-1`, versus the number `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way we can approach this problem is by generating a random number strictly from the numbers available. We can construct the list of available numbers by subtracting the set of integers in `lst` from the set of integers in the range `0` to `n-1`. Then, we can simply generate a random number within `0` and the length of this new list, and return the integer at that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution takes $O(N)$ time to pre-process the list, and $O(1)$ time to generate a random integer."
